# Object Oriented Programming in C#

These are the labworks of my university object oriented programming course. Looking back, I'm glad I took it, it was good fun and kind of broke and re.. a guess reinvented (for lack of a better word) the way I write code, honnestly, I wish I took this course earlier. 

You can find all of the assignments [here](https://litmo.notion.site/is-oop-y26-3d98c649fe5c42ed9699df11e2058880).
